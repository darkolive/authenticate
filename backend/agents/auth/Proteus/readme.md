# Proteus

**Origin:** Greek Mythology  
**Inspired by:** Proteus, the shape-shifting sea god known for his elusive nature — able to assume many forms, but ultimately revealing truth to those who persist.

## Purpose

`Proteus` is the identity resolution agent responsible for comparing **multiple representations of identity** and determining whether they belong to the **same individual**.

It is used when identities take different forms — such as across devices, sessions, biometric hashes, or federated login systems — but must be resolved to a **single, persistent user identity**.
